I have learned Flutter & Dart this semester, which helped me understand mobile applications. I was able to create a game called RidPix.

The applications are:
1- Four Pictures and One word that describes them all is the aim of 2- the game.
3- From casual gamers to more involved gamers alike will enjoy the game. 
4-With different categories to choose from such as Anime, Games, and Movies, among others.Whether at home or on the go, it's never-ending fun for everyone.

Why this Application
1- Easy to use by anyone and all ages.
2- Simple idea, but with a lot of fun. 
3- capable to infatuate you by providing many mysterious and adventurous levels.
4- The ability to use different features(Key, hint, and more).
A good brain exercise.
